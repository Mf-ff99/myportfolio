                    <p>Hello! My name is Mark Force, I am a student and software engineer currently working through the
                        Thinkfull bootcamp program. Welcome to my portfolio. Here you can contact me, look through my
                        completed and current projects, as well as learn a little more about me. I am skilled in Python,
                        Javascript, CSS, and HTML programming. I have several projects currently underway, and that
                        along with Thinkful takes up the majority of my time. I've always been in love with programming.
                        There are few things I enjoy in life more than coding, and I hope what you find on my page will
                        inspire you to start coding yourself.</p>

                        <h1>
                            Hello! Mark here!
                        </h1>
                        <p>
                            I just wanted to introduce myself. I am a novelist and programmer from Central Florida. I
                            have always had an interest in programming, whether it was sneaking behind my parents back
                            to play Scratch at all hours of the night to working on ambitious Python-based adventure
                            games and learning-development apps.</p>

                        <p>
                            I also work as a camera assistant and operator, drone pilot and operator, and technician in
                            Florida and wherever the jobs take me. Working as a freelance independent-contractor I am
                            able to pick and choose my schedule. I owned and operated a window cleaning company in
                            Central Florida starting when I was 15. Through the years I have traveled the world and
                            learned many different skills, but each time I have come back to programming. The hands-on
                            skills I have picked up over the years has enabled me to problem solve and work my way
                            through the learning process with determination and capability.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            One of my dreams is to be able to offer future clients proficiency in debugging,
                            problem-solving, and quickly coming up with long-term solutions. It is imperative to
                            understand the fundamentals of development, from the planning stages to completion, and a
                            skill I am happy to offer my clients.

                            This app will utilize a space-repetition learning system to easily add words and phrases to
                            decks of 'cards'. Complete with quizes, deck-customization, and more. Currently in the works, expect some news in the coming months.

                            bathroom, toilet, or restroom in the vicinity. At least, that you're aware of. This app is
                            coming soon so help you find a place of relief when you need it the most.</p>
